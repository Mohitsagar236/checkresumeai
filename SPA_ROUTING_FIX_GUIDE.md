# SPA Routing Fix for CheckResumeAI on Vercel

## The Issue: 404 NOT_FOUND Errors

When deploying a React/Vite Single-Page Application (SPA) with client-side routing to Vercel, 404 NOT_FOUND errors can occur when:

1. Refreshing the page on a route other than the home page
2. Accessing a route directly via URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard`)
3. Sharing links to specific pages in your application

This happens because Vercel's server looks for physical files at those paths, but with client-side routing (e.g., React Router), these paths are handled by your React application, not by actual files on the server.

## The Solution

To fix this issue, we've implemented the following solutions:

### 1. Updated `vercel.json` Configuration

The `vercel.json` file now includes the following key settings:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/assets/(.*)", "destination": "/assets/$1" },
    { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "/api/$1" },
    { "source": "/static/(.*)", "destination": "/static/$1" },
    { "source": "/(.*\\.[a-z0-9]+)", "destination": "/$1" },
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ],
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false
}
```

#### Key configuration elements:

1. **Rewrite Rules**: The most important part for client-side routing
   - Asset-specific rules route specific paths to their corresponding destinations
   - The catch-all rule `"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html"` ensures that any route not matching a specific file is routed to your React app's entry point

2. **Clean URLs**: `"cleanUrls": true` - Removes the need for .html extensions in URLs

3. **No Trailing Slashes**: `"trailingSlash": false` - Prevents automatic addition of trailing slashes

### 2. Additional Fallbacks

1. **Netlify-style `_redirects` file**: Created at `project/public/_redirects` with the content:
   ```
   /* /index.html 200
   ```

2. **200.html Fallback**: Created a copy of `index.html` as `200.html` in the build output directory

## How to Verify the Fix

After deploying to Vercel:

1. Run the `verify-routes-after-deploy.ps1` script to automatically test multiple routes
2. Test manually by directly accessing routes like `/login`, `/dashboard`, etc.
3. Refresh the browser while on internal routes
4. Try sharing direct links to internal pages

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter 404 errors:

1. Check that `vercel.json` is at the root of your repository
2. Ensure the Vercel build completed successfully
3. Verify the correct structure of your dist directory
4. Make sure React Router is using `BrowserRouter` (not `HashRouter`)

## Next Steps

After confirming the routing fix works:

1. Set up any custom domains if needed
2. Configure environment variables for production
3. Set up monitoring with Vercel Analytics
4. Update your bookmarks and shared links to use direct URLs instead of always linking to the homepage

The fix has been successfully implemented, and your CheckResumeAI application should now handle all routes correctly!
