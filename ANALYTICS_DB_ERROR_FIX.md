# Analytics Database Error Fix

## Issue
Users were encountering the following error when trying to view analytics:
```
Error Loading Analytics
relation "public.user_analytics" does not exist
```

This error occurs when the application tries to query a database table that doesn't exist in the Supabase database.

## Root Cause
The application was trying to access the `user_analytics` table, but this table hasn't been created in the database yet or has a different name than expected. This typically happens when:

1. There's a mismatch between development/production database schemas
2. Database migrations haven't been fully applied 
3. Table names have changed during development

## Solution
This fix implements a robust solution with multiple fallbacks:

### 1. Table Name Fallbacks
The fix tries multiple possible table names when querying the database:
- First tries the expected table name (`user_analytics`)
- If that fails, tries alternative names (`analytics`)
- Applies the same fallback approach for the trends table

### 2. Mock Data Fallback
If all database queries fail:
- The application generates realistic mock data
- This ensures users always see something instead of an error
- UI clearly indicates when displaying mock data vs. real data

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Detailed error logging to help diagnose database issues
- Specific error detection for "relation does not exist" errors
- Graceful recovery without page crashes

### 4. Real-time Subscriptions
- Listens for data on all possible table names
- Ensures real-time updates work regardless of table naming

## Implementation Details

The fix modifies the `analytics.ts` API service to:

1. Define table name constants with fallbacks
2. Add cascade fallback logic in all database query functions
3. Add a mock data generator for worst-case scenarios 
4. Improve error handling and logging throughout

## How to Deploy

1. Run the provided PowerShell script: `.\fix-analytics-db-error.ps1`
2. Test locally to ensure there are no new errors
3. Commit and deploy through your normal CI/CD process

## Long-term Solution
While this fix ensures users can use the application without errors, consider these long-term solutions:

1. Standardize database table names across environments
2. Create proper database migrations to ensure schema consistency
3. Add database health checks to detect and alert on schema mismatches
