# Deployment Script PATH Issues Fixed

This update addresses the "Required tools are not installed or not in the PATH" error when running the deployment scripts.

## Changes Made

1. **Added new helper scripts:**

   - `fix-path-and-deploy.ps1`: Automatically fixes PATH issues for AWS CLI and EB CLI in the current PowerShell session
   - `deployment-diagnostic.ps1`: Provides detailed diagnostics about your deployment environment

2. **Updated documentation:**

   - Added troubleshooting section to the main README
   - Created comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` guide

## How to Use

If you encounter the "Required tools are not installed or not in the PATH" error:

1. Run the diagnostic tool first to understand the issue:

   ```powershell
   .\deployment-diagnostic.ps1
   ```

2. Use the PATH fix script to resolve the issue:

   ```powershell
   .\fix-path-and-deploy.ps1
   ```

3. If you still have issues, refer to `DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed manual steps

## Root Cause

The main issue was that the PowerShell session doesn't automatically refresh environment variables after installing tools. The AWS CLI and EB CLI were installed correctly but weren't accessible in the current session without restarting PowerShell or refreshing the PATH.

The new scripts resolve this by:

- Refreshing the PATH environment variable
- Locating the installed tools using common installation paths
- Creating aliases for the current session
- Offering to run the deployment script with the corrected environment
