📋 Manual Testing Instructions:

1. Open the browser dev tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for these specific issues:

❌ OLD ISSUES TO VERIFY ARE FIXED:
   • "bundleOptimization.tsx:177 No start time found for app-initialization"
   • "Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist."

✅ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX:
   • No "No start time found" warnings during app startup
   • Chrome extension errors are suppressed or show friendly messages
   • Performance monitoring shows "✅ Performance: app-initialization completed in XXXms"

🔍 TO TEST THE FIXES:
   1. Refresh the page (F5) and watch the console during page load
   2. Look for the startup performance message instead of the warning
   3. Chrome extension errors should be suppressed in production

🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   ✓ No "No start time found for app-initialization" warnings
   ✓ Performance timing works correctly with positive timing messages
   ✓ Chrome extension errors are handled gracefully
   ✓ Console output is cleaner during development
