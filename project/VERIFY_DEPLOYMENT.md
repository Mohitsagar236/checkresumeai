# Verifying Your CheckResumeAI Deployment

After deploying your application to Vercel and connecting your custom domain `www.checkresumeai.com`, follow these steps to verify everything is working correctly.

## 1. Basic Page Loading

- Visit your main page: `https://www.checkresumeai.com/`
- Ensure all styles, images, and UI elements load correctly
- Check that there are no console errors in your browser's developer tools (F12)

## 2. SPA Routing Tests

Test these scenarios to ensure client-side routing is working:

1. **Navigation through UI**: Click through different sections of your application
2. **Direct URL access**: Visit these URLs directly in your browser:
   - `https://www.checkresumeai.com/login`
   - `https://www.checkresumeai.com/dashboard`
   - `https://www.checkresumeai.com/profile`
3. **Page refreshing**: While on a page like `/dashboard`, refresh the browser
4. **Deep linking**: Copy a URL from one of your inner pages and open it in a different browser window

## 3. PDF Processing Functionality

Test the resume upload and analysis features:

1. Upload a PDF resume
2. Ensure the PDF is correctly parsed and displayed
3. Check that the analysis is performed and results are shown

## 4. Authentication

Test user authentication flow:

1. Sign up with a new account
2. Log out
3. Log back in using those credentials
4. Reset password functionality (if implemented)

## 5. Payment Integration (Razorpay)

Test the payment workflow:

1. Access the premium features or subscription pages
2. Initiate a test payment
3. Verify the payment process completes successfully
4. Check that premium features are unlocked after payment

## 6. Policy Pages

Ensure that all policy pages required by Razorpay are accessible:

- Privacy Policy: `/privacy`
- Terms and Conditions: `/terms`
- Refund Policy: `/refunds`
- Shipping Policy: `/shipping`

## 7. Check Mobile Responsiveness

Test the website on different device sizes:

1. Use browser developer tools to simulate mobile devices
2. Test on actual mobile devices if possible
3. Verify all features work correctly on smaller screens

## 8. Performance Testing

1. Check page load times
2. Test with slow internet connections (using browser dev tools)
3. Ensure large PDF files can be processed without issues

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Potential Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| 404 errors | Check vercel.json rewrites and _redirects configurations |
| API errors | Verify environment variables are set correctly |
| PDF worker issues | Check PDF.js worker files in public directory |
| Payment failures | Check Razorpay allowed domains configuration |
| Slow performance | Check asset sizes and optimization |

If you encounter persistent issues, check the Vercel deployment logs for more specific error details.

## Post-Deployment Suggestions

After successfully verifying your deployment:

1. Set up monitoring to catch any runtime errors (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
2. Configure analytics to track user behavior (if applicable)
3. Create a backup of your working configuration
4. Document any custom changes you've made for future reference
