# 431 Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing **431 Request Header Fields Too Large** errors when processing large resume content through the Groq API.

## Root Cause
- Large resume content was being sent directly in API requests without proper size validation
- Request bodies were exceeding server limits (typically 32KB for headers and body combined)
- No preprocessing or content truncation was in place to prevent oversized requests

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Content Size Management
- **Reduced token limits**: Lowered `MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST` from 6000 to 4000
- **Added request size limit**: Implemented `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE` of 32KB
- **Content truncation**: Added intelligent content truncation at sentence boundaries

### 2. Request Size Validation
- **Pre-request validation**: Check content size before making API calls
- **Request body size monitoring**: Validate final request body size
- **Intelligent truncation**: Truncate content while preserving meaning

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Specific 431 error handling**: Don't retry 431 errors, they indicate fundamental size issues
- **Better error messages**: Include actual request sizes in error messages
- **Fallback behavior**: Return mock data when content is too large

### 4. Content Preprocessing
- **Resume analysis**: Max 8000 characters
- **ATS scoring**: Max 6000 characters  
- **Skills analysis**: Max 6000 characters
- **Smart truncation**: Preserve important content while reducing size

### 5. Request Monitoring
- **Size logging**: Track request sizes and warn when approaching limits
- **Token counting**: Monitor token usage alongside byte size
- **Proactive warnings**: Alert when requests are approaching size limits

## Key Functions Added

### `estimateRequestSize(content: string): number`
Calculates the estimated size of the full HTTP request including headers and JSON structure.

### `truncateContent(content: string, maxSize: number): string`
Intelligently truncates content at sentence boundaries while staying within size limits.

### `REQUEST_MONITORING`
Utilities for logging and validating request sizes before sending to the API.

## Benefits
1. **Prevents 431 errors**: Proactive size management prevents oversized requests
2. **Better user experience**: Graceful handling of large content with informative messages
3. **Improved reliability**: Reduced API failures due to size constraints
4. **Performance optimization**: Smaller requests mean faster processing
5. **Cost efficiency**: Reduced token usage through intelligent content management

## Testing
- Test with various resume sizes (small, medium, large)
- Verify content truncation preserves meaning
- Confirm 431 errors are eliminated
- Validate that analysis quality remains acceptable with truncated content

## Monitoring
- Watch console logs for size warnings
- Monitor API response times
- Track success rates for different content sizes
- Review truncation frequency to optimize limits
