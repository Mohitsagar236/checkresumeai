# PDF Viewer Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented to address PDF rendering issues in the FixedPdfViewer component.

## Problems Fixed

1. **"Cannot read properties of null (reading 'sendWithPromise')"**
   - Issue: This error occurred when the PDF.js worker was incorrectly destroyed or lost connection
   - Solution: Implemented stable worker port retention using the internal `_worker.port` property

2. **"Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getContext')"**
   - Issue: This error occurred when canvas context was not available or was lost during rendering
   - Solution: Added proper fallbacks for context acquisition and recovery logic

3. **"Loading aborted" PDF loading errors**
   - Issue: PDF loading was being aborted due to worker initialization issues
   - Solution: Added proper worker initialization with test document and retry mechanisms

4. **"Canvas context not available yet" console messages**
   - Issue: Component attempted to render before canvas was ready
   - Solution: Added explicit canvas and context initialization and checking

## Key Implementation Details

### Worker Stability

```typescript
// Store a reference to the worker port
const workerPortRef = useRef<MessagePort | null>(null);

// During initialization, we get the worker port:
workerPortRef.current = testTask._worker?.port || null;

// During PDF loading, we reuse the worker port:
if (workerPortRef.current) {
  loadingTaskRef.current._worker = { port: workerPortRef.current };
}
```

### Canvas Context Reliability

```typescript
// Initialize canvas context when canvas is available
useEffect(() => {
  const canvas = canvasRef.current;
  if (!canvas || contextRef.current) return;

  try {
    // Try different context configurations to maximize compatibility
    let context: CanvasRenderingContext2D | null = canvas.getContext('2d');
    // Fallback options if needed...
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Canvas initialization error:', err);
  }
}, []);
```

### Error Recovery

We've implemented error recovery for:

1. Worker communication errors (`sendWithPromise`)
2. Canvas context loss (`getContext`)
3. Loading aborted errors
4. Timeout protection

## CSS Improvements

Replaced inline styles with data attributes:

```html
<div 
  className="pdf-viewer"
  data-width={width}
  data-height={height}
>
```

And corresponding CSS:

```css
.pdf-viewer[data-width] {
  width: attr(data-width);
}

.pdf-viewer[data-height] {
  height: attr(data-height);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Worker Initialization**: Always initialize the worker before loading PDFs
2. **Error Handling**: Handle specific error types with targeted recovery mechanisms
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Properly cleanup documents with `.cleanup()` instead of `.destroy()`
4. **Context Testing**: Test canvas context with a draw operation before actual use
5. **Timeout Protection**: Use Promise.race() with timeouts to prevent infinite waiting
