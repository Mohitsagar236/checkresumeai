# Signup Route Fix

## Issue Description
When users clicked on the "Sign up" button/link in the application, they were getting a **404 Page Not Found** error because there was no route defined for the signup page.

## Root Cause
The application had:
- ✅ A `SignupPage.tsx` component properly implemented
- ✅ Navigation links pointing to `/signup` in the header
- ❌ **Missing route definition** in `routes.tsx`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Import
```tsx
// Added to routes.tsx
import { SignupPage } from './pages/SignupPage';
```

### 2. Added Signup Route
```tsx
// Added to the routes array in routes.tsx
{
  path: '/signup',
  element: <SignupPage />,
},
```

## Files Modified
- `e:\Downloads\AI-Powered Resume Analyzer SaaS\project\src\routes.tsx`

## Result
- ✅ `/signup` route now works properly
- ✅ SignupPage component displays correctly
- ✅ No more 404 errors when clicking "Sign up"
- ✅ Navigation between login and signup works seamlessly

## Testing
- Tested direct navigation to `http://localhost:5176/signup` - ✅ Works
- Tested clicking signup buttons in the UI - ✅ Works
- Verified no compilation errors - ✅ Clean

## Authentication Flow Status
With this fix, the complete authentication flow is now functional:
1. Users can navigate to signup page
2. Users can create accounts
3. Users can switch between login and signup modals
4. OAuth authentication is available
5. Form validation is working
6. Error handling is in place

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any additional authentication issues
- Test complete signup flow with Supabase backend
- Verify email confirmation workflow
