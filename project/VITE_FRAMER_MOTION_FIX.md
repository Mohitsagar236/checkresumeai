# Docker Build Fix - Deno to Node.js Migration - COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION

## Issue Description
The Docker build was failing with the following error:
```
error: Relative import path "dotenv" not prefixed with / or ./ or ../
    at file:///app/project/backend/src/config/index.ts:1:20

✕ [6/7] RUN deno cache project/backend/src/config/index.ts 
process "/bin/bash -ol pipefail -c deno cache project/backend/src/config/index.ts" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Wrong Runtime**: The build system was trying to use Deno commands on a Node.js/TypeScript project
2. **Import Syntax**: Deno requires explicit file extensions and relative paths, while Node.js uses module resolution
3. **Build Configuration**: There was a mismatch between the actual project structure (Node.js) and build commands (Deno)
4. **Cache Issues**: Old Docker layers might be cached with incorrect build instructions

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Use Nixpacks (Recommended)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project is designed for Nixpacks, not Docker

**For Railway Deployment:**
```bash
# No special commands needed - Railway will automatically use nixpacks.toml
# Just push your code and Railway handles the build
```

The project already has proper configuration:
- `nixpacks.toml` - Configured for Node.js 20
- `railway.toml` - Configured to use Nixpacks builder
- `package.json` - Proper Node.js scripts

### Alternative: Fixed Docker Build

If you specifically need Docker deployment, the Dockerfile has been completely rewritten:

## Recommended Solution

### For Railway Deployment (Recommended)
Use the existing Nixpacks configuration which is already properly set up:

```bash
# The nixpacks.toml file handles the build process automatically
# Just deploy to Railway and it will use Nixpacks
```

The current `nixpacks.toml` configuration:
- Uses Node.js 20
- Installs dependencies with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Builds with `npm run build`
- Starts the backend server correctly

### For Docker Deployment (Alternative)
If you specifically need Docker deployment, the fixed Dockerfile is now available, but ensure your build scripts are compatible:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t checkresumeai .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 checkresumeai
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Replaced Empty Dockerfile
- The original Dockerfile was empty
- Created a proper multi-stage Dockerfile for Node.js application

### 2. Multi-Stage Docker Build
Created a three-stage build process:

#### Stage 1: Frontend Builder
- Uses Node.js 18 Alpine base image
- Installs frontend dependencies
- Builds the Vite/React frontend application

#### Stage 2: Backend Builder  
- Uses Node.js 18 Alpine base image
- Installs backend dependencies
- Compiles TypeScript backend to JavaScript

#### Stage 3: Production
- Uses Node.js 18 Alpine base image
- Copies built frontend and backend artifacts
- Configures for production deployment
- Includes health check endpoint
- Exposes port 5000

### 3. Key Features of New Dockerfile
- **Multi-stage build**: Optimizes final image size
- **Production-ready**: Only includes necessary production dependencies
- **Health check**: Built-in health monitoring
- **Security**: Uses Alpine Linux for smaller attack surface
- **Efficient**: Leverages Docker layer caching

## Build Process
```bash
# Frontend build
npm run build:frontend

# Backend build  
cd backend && npm run build

# Docker build
docker build -t checkresumeai .
```

## Files Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Complete rewrite for Node.js instead of Deno

## Testing
The Docker build should now complete successfully without Deno-related errors.

## Next Steps
1. Test the Docker build: `docker build -t checkresumeai .`
2. Test the container: `docker run -p 5000:5000 checkresumeai`
3. Verify the health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`

## Notes
- The vulnerability warnings about the Node.js base image are informational and don't prevent the build
- Consider updating to newer Node.js versions for security improvements
- The health check ensures the container is responsive before routing traffic

## Troubleshooting Docker Build Issues

### If you're still getting "deno cache" errors:

1. **Clear Docker Cache:**
   ```bash
   # Clear all Docker cache
   docker system prune -a -f
   
   # Rebuild without cache
   docker build --no-cache -t checkresumeai .
   ```

2. **Check Docker Context:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the project directory
   cd /path/to/project
   
   # Check if Dockerfile exists and is correct
   head -10 Dockerfile
   ```

3. **Verify Build Scripts:**
   ```bash
   # Use the provided Windows build script
   .\build-docker.bat
   
   # Or use the Linux/Mac build script
   ./build-docker.sh
   ```

### If errors persist:

The issue might be:
- **Old Docker layers**: The system is using cached layers from a previous Deno-based build
- **Wrong build context**: Docker is building from the wrong directory
- **Configuration override**: Another build system is interfering

**Solution**: Use the recommended Nixpacks deployment instead of Docker.

## Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# For Railway (Recommended)
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Docker build - use Nixpacks"
git push origin main
# Railway will automatically build using nixpacks.toml

# For Docker (if specifically needed)
docker system prune -a -f  # Clear cache
docker build --no-cache -t checkresumeai .  # Build fresh
```

## Files Fixed/Created

- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Complete rewrite for Node.js (multi-stage build)
- ✅ `build-docker.sh` - Linux/Mac build script
- ✅ `build-docker.bat` - Windows build script
- ✅ `VITE_FRAMER_MOTION_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Final Recommendation

**Use Nixpacks for Railway deployment** - it's already configured and working. The Docker build fix is provided as an alternative, but Nixpacks is the preferred and tested method for this project.
