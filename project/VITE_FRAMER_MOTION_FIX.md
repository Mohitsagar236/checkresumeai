# Docker Build Fix - Deno to Node.js Migration

## Issue Description
The Docker build was failing with the following error:
```
✕ [6/7] RUN deno cache project/backend/src/config/index.ts 
process "/bin/bash -ol pipefail -c deno cache project/backend/src/config/index.ts" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Wrong Runtime**: The Dockerfile was configured to use Deno commands (`deno cache`) but the project is actually a Node.js/TypeScript project, not a Deno project.
2. **Empty Dockerfile**: The original Dockerfile was empty, causing confusion about the build process.
3. **Preferred Builder**: This project is actually configured to use **Nixpacks** (see `nixpacks.toml`), not Docker for Railway deployment.

## Important Note: Nixpacks vs Docker
⚠️ **This project is configured to use Nixpacks, not Docker, for Railway deployment**

The `.dockerignore` file contains a comment indicating that Nixpacks is the preferred builder:
```
# This file ensures Docker is not used, and instead Nixpacks is the preferred builder
```

For Railway deployment, use the existing `nixpacks.toml` configuration which properly handles the Node.js build process.

## Recommended Solution

### For Railway Deployment (Recommended)
Use the existing Nixpacks configuration which is already properly set up:

```bash
# The nixpacks.toml file handles the build process automatically
# Just deploy to Railway and it will use Nixpacks
```

The current `nixpacks.toml` configuration:
- Uses Node.js 20
- Installs dependencies with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Builds with `npm run build`
- Starts the backend server correctly

### For Docker Deployment (Alternative)
If you specifically need Docker deployment, the fixed Dockerfile is now available, but ensure your build scripts are compatible:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t checkresumeai .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 checkresumeai
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Replaced Empty Dockerfile
- The original Dockerfile was empty
- Created a proper multi-stage Dockerfile for Node.js application

### 2. Multi-Stage Docker Build
Created a three-stage build process:

#### Stage 1: Frontend Builder
- Uses Node.js 18 Alpine base image
- Installs frontend dependencies
- Builds the Vite/React frontend application

#### Stage 2: Backend Builder  
- Uses Node.js 18 Alpine base image
- Installs backend dependencies
- Compiles TypeScript backend to JavaScript

#### Stage 3: Production
- Uses Node.js 18 Alpine base image
- Copies built frontend and backend artifacts
- Configures for production deployment
- Includes health check endpoint
- Exposes port 5000

### 3. Key Features of New Dockerfile
- **Multi-stage build**: Optimizes final image size
- **Production-ready**: Only includes necessary production dependencies
- **Health check**: Built-in health monitoring
- **Security**: Uses Alpine Linux for smaller attack surface
- **Efficient**: Leverages Docker layer caching

## Build Process
```bash
# Frontend build
npm run build:frontend

# Backend build  
cd backend && npm run build

# Docker build
docker build -t checkresumeai .
```

## Files Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Complete rewrite for Node.js instead of Deno

## Testing
The Docker build should now complete successfully without Deno-related errors.

## Next Steps
1. Test the Docker build: `docker build -t checkresumeai .`
2. Test the container: `docker run -p 5000:5000 checkresumeai`
3. Verify the health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`

## Notes
- The vulnerability warnings about the Node.js base image are informational and don't prevent the build
- Consider updating to newer Node.js versions for security improvements
- The health check ensures the container is responsive before routing traffic
