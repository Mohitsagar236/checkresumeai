# CheckResumeAI Deployment Issues Fixed

This guide explains how we fixed two critical issues with your Vercel deployment:

## Issue 1: Failed to fetch Git submodules

### Symptoms:
- Error message: `Warning: Failed to fetch one or more git submodules`
- The `project` directory was being tracked as a Git submodule

### Cause:
Your repository had the `project` directory set up as a Git submodule. When Vercel tries to clone your repository, it was having trouble fetching this submodule correctly.

### Solution:
1. We created the `fix-git-submodule-and-deploy.ps1` script that:
   - Identifies if `project` is being tracked as a submodule
   - Creates a backup of the project directory for safety
   - Deinitializes the submodule but keeps all files
   - Removes the submodule references from Git's configuration
   - Adds the project files to the main repository

2. After running this script, the `project` directory will be a normal part of your main repository, not a submodule.

## Issue 2: Missing "build" script

### Symptoms:
- Error message: `npm error Missing script: "build"`
- Deployment failing because Vercel couldn't find the right build command

### Cause:
Vercel was looking for a build script in the root `package.json` file, but your actual build scripts were located in the `project/package.json` file.

### Solution:
1. We updated the root `package.json` to include proper build scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "cd project && npm run build",
     "vercel-build": "cd project && npm run vercel-build"
   }
   ```

2. We added a root-level `vercel.json` file with correct configurations:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "buildCommand": "cd project && npm run vercel-build",
     "outputDirectory": "project/dist",
     "installCommand": "cd project && npm install && npm run setup-pdf-worker",
     // ... other configurations ...
   }
   ```
   This tells Vercel to:
   - Run the build command inside the project directory
   - Look for the built files in project/dist
   - Install dependencies in the project directory

## Fixing SPA Routing

The updated `vercel.json` also includes proper configuration for client-side routing:
```json
"rewrites": [
  { "source": "/assets/(.*)", "destination": "/assets/$1" },
  { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "/api/$1" },
  { "source": "/static/(.*)", "destination": "/static/$1" },
  { "source": "/(.*\\.[a-z0-9]+)", "destination": "/$1" },
  { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
]
```

This ensures that all routes in your single-page application will correctly route to index.html, preventing 404 errors.

## How to Deploy

### Method 1: Using the Fix Script (Recommended)
1. Run the `fix-git-submodule-and-deploy.ps1` script:
   ```
   .\fix-git-submodule-and-deploy.ps1
   ```
   This script will fix the Git submodule issue and deploy directly to Vercel.

### Method 2: Manual Fix
1. Run the Git commands to remove the submodule:
   ```
   git submodule deinit -f project
   git config --local --remove-section submodule.project
   rm -rf .git/modules/project
   ```

2. Add the project files to the main repository:
   ```
   git add project/
   git commit -m "Fix: Convert project from submodule to regular directory"
   ```

3. Push to your GitHub repository
   ```
   git push
   ```

4. Deploy from the Vercel dashboard

## Verifying Your Deployment

After deploying, check the following:

1. Proper build output in Vercel logs
2. Client-side routing works (test direct URLs)
3. All assets load correctly
